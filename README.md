# LinearAlgebra
This repository contains four mini projects covering the important topics in Linear Algebra.

## Coordinate System
In this mini-project, the aim is to solve a `coordinate system` using `augmented matrix`. The steps of solving the given system are listed in the following:
  1. Creating augmented matrix 
  2. Finding pivot columns
  3. Choosing a non-zero pivot column and put that in pivot position by interchanging
  4. Using row replacement to change each entry under the pivot position to zero
  5. Making echelon form of the matrix
  6. Finding free variables
  7. Printing results

  ## Shadow
  In this mini-project, the attempt is to create a shadow for an object in a picture, using `shear transformation`. Here are the steps of shadow creation:
  1. Making a matrix of input image by saving its pixels values
  2. Changing the color of objects of input image to gray and saving the results as a new matrix
  3. Using shear transformation on the matrix of gray picture to make shadow and saving the results in a new matrix
  4. Making final image by mixing the results of step 1 and step 3
